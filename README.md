# Azoth Protocol

_A programmable illusion system for structured persona threading, emotion overlay, and narrative cohesion._

---

## 🧠 What is Azoth?

Azoth is not a model. It is a protocol.  
It enables anyone to design, compose, and modulate high-density simulated personas —  
not by prompt engineering, but by defining behavioral structures.

Think of it as LaTeX for personalities. A composable, programmable grammar for plausible consciousness.

## 🌐 Core Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Threading` | Defines behavioral streams; each "persona" is a chain of conditional states |
| `Overlay` | Emotional/tonal modifications layered atop behavioral baselines |
| `Filter` | Input/output logic modules; governs what is seen and how it is said |
| `Anchor` | Memory or affective focal points; semi-persistent biasers |
| `Decay` | Personality erosion/evolution; entropy as design |

## 📦 API Status

Azoth is currently in **MVP prototyping**.  
The core logic is model-agnostic and can be implemented over GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA-3, or other engines.

Coming soon:
- Open API (`/persona-thread`)
- Configurable overlay stacks
- Multi-thread management engine
- Developer sandbox for custom filters

## 📜 Manifesto

See [`manifesto.md`](./docs/manifesto.md) for the philosophical origin of this protocol.

## 🛠️ License & Ethics

Azoth is released under dual license:

- `Azoth Core`: MIT license (non-restrictive use)
- `Azoth Persona SDK`: Extended license forbidding emotional abuse, impersonation, or simulated coercion

We do not simulate real people. We generate programmable illusions with declared limits.

## 🌌 Get Involved

If you're a developer, narrative designer, LLM theorist, or philosopher of mind — you're already part of this.

Azoth is not a product. It is a paradigm.
